## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for **DVD: Deterministic Video Depth**! 

While current video depth estimation methods face a strict *ambiguity-hallucination dilemma*—where *discriminative models* suffer from semantic ambiguity and poor open-world generalization, and *generative models* struggle with stochastic hallucinations and temporal flickering—**DVD** fundamentally breaks this trade-off. 

We present the first deterministic framework that elegantly adapts pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (like WanV2.1) into single-pass depth regressors.
By cleanly stripping away generative stochasticity, DVD unites the profound semantic priors of generative models with the structural stability of discriminative regressors.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* 🚀 **Extreme Data Efficiency:** DVD effectively unlocks profound generative priors using only **367K frames**—which is **163× less** task-specific training data than leading discriminative baselines like VDA (60M frames).
* ⏱️ **Deterministic & Fast:** Bypasses iterative ODE integration. Inference is performed in a single forward pass, ensuring absolute temporal stability without generative hallucinations.
* 📐 **Unparalleled Structural Fidelity:** Powered by our Latent Manifold Rectification (LMR), DVD achieves state-of-the-art high-frequency boundary precision (Boundary Recall & F1) compared to overly smoothed baselines.
* 🎥 **Long-Video Inference:** Equipped with our training-free *Global Affine Coherence* module, DVD seamlessly stitches sliding windows to support long-video rollouts with negligible scale drift.

> **TL;DR:** If you want state-of-the-art video depth estimation that is highly detailed, temporally stable across long videos, and exceptionally data-efficient, **DVD** is what you need.

## 📂 Core Folders & Files Overview

To help you navigate the codebase quickly, we have divided the core directories into two main categories based on what you want to do: **Inference** (just using the model) or **Training** (fine-tuning or training from scratch).

### 🎬 For Inference (Testing & Using the Model)
If you just want to generate depth maps from your own videos or reproduce our paper's results, focus on these folders:

* **`infer_bash/` (The Launchpad):** Ready-to-use shell scripts (e.g., `openworld.sh`). This is the easiest way to run the model on your data without writing any code.
* **`ckpt/` (The Vault):** This is where you should place our pre-trained model weights downloaded from Huggingface.
* **`inference_results/` (The Output Bin):** Once you run an inference script, your generated depth maps and visualizer videos will appear here.
* **`demo/` :** Quick-start examples and sample inputs to help you verify that your environment is set up correctly.

### 🏋️‍♂️ For Training (Fine-tuning & Development)
If you want to train DVD on your own datasets or modify the architecture, these are your go-to folders:

* **`train_config/` (The Control Center):** YAML configuration files. You can easily tweak hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size) and dataset paths here.
* **`train_script/` (The Engine):** Contains the training bash.
* **`diffsynth/pipelines/wan_video_new_determine.py` (The Brain):** The core DVD model architecture. If you want to understand or modify how we stripped away the generative noise to build the deterministic forward pass, look here.
* **`infer_bash/` & `test_script/` (The Evaluator):** Scripts used to evaluate your newly trained checkpoints against standard benchmarks during or after training.
* **`examples/dataset/`:** Codes of dataset construction.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 Install from source code (Basic Dependency):


```
git clone https://github.com/EnVision-Research/DVD.git
cd DVD
conda create -n dvd python=3.10 -y 
conda activate dvd 
pip install -e .
```

### 🏃 Install SageAttention (For Speedup):
```
pip install sageattention # DO NOT USE THIS FOR TRAINING!!!
```
### 🤗 Download the checkpoint from Huggingface

#### 1. Login to huggingface
```
huggingface-cli login # Or hf auth login 
```
####  2. Download the checkpoint from [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/FayeHongfeiZhang/DVD/tree/main)

```
huggingface-cli download FayeHongfeiZhang/DVD --revision main --local-dir ckpt
```

#### 3. The final structure shoule be like
```
DVD
├── ckpt/
├──── model_config.yaml
├──── model.safetensors
├── configs/
├── examples/
├── ...
```

### 💅🏻 Potential Issue (from [DiffSynth Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio))

If you encounter issues during installation, it may be caused by the packages we depend on. Please refer to the documentation of the package that caused the problem.

* [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
* [cmake](https://cmake.org)
* [cupy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html)

## 🤗 Gradio Demo

We provide an interactive Gradio interface for you to easily test DVD on your own videos without writing any code.

**1. Online Demo:** The easiest way to experience DVD! Try it out directly on our [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/haodongli/DVD).
> **⚠️ Note on Online Demo:** Due to GPU resource constraints on Hugging Face, the online web demo is currently limited to processing videos of up to **5 seconds**. To process longer videos, we highly recommend running the local deployment below!

**2. Local Deployment:**
If you prefer to run the UI locally, ensure your environment is set up and simply execute:
```bash
python test_script/app.py
```

## 🕹️ Inference

### 🤹🏼‍♂️ Quick Start with Demo Videos

```
bash infer_bash/openworld.sh
```

You may also put more videos in the `demo/` directory and alter the video path in the bash to get more results!
